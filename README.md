# blackjack-game

The game of blackjack has two players, the House and the Player, in a race to get a card total of 21.

To play blackjack, the House and the Player are both given two initial card values, and the Player can pick whether they'd like to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn) depending on how close they are to a sum of 21. After the Player phase, the House can select whether to hit or stand as well.

After both the House and the Player have made their moves, the round is over, and whoever was closest to 21 is the winner. If one of the players reached a card total of over 21, they "bust" (lose that round because their sum was over 21).

In this game, you play as the Player while the House is represented by an AI. You can play as many times as you want, so see how many times you can win in Blackjack!
